      <h2 align="center">Does White hole exist?</h2>
      <p>According to my research chances are <b>negative</b> for whitehole to exist Because basic idea of whitehole to exist is that in universe everything has it's positive negative and neutral form but blackhole can be considered in star family because after death of a star blackhole is formed we can say star is positive, neutron star is negative and blackhole is neutral because if star(+) meets neutron star(-) then they'll produce humongous energy and neutralize now star is positive because neuclear reaction in it produces proton and we know neutron star is made of electrons but blackhole can absorb both types of star and add to it's mass because it's neutral<br><br>next thing of whotehole is it repels everything in it's way means antigravity if we saw in the perspective of theory of reletivity it is imposible for our current physics knowledge.</p>

      <h2>What is dark matter and dark energy</h2>
      <p>During 1900's many scientist were shocked to find that many galaxies actual mass is more than the calculated mass then in 1920s <b>fritz zwicky</b> theorized that there is a matter which adds up to galaxy mass but doesn't interact with anything and light passes through it so it can't be seen but it makes up 25% mass of universe but there is still no solid evidence <b>Dark Energy</b> is a force that holds galaxies from colliding because only gravity will pull the galaxies <i>i know you will think centripital force prevents star and planets from colliding with their parents but here we are talking about galaxies and they don't circle each other</i></p>

      <h2>How to find aliens?</h2>
      <img src="Drake.jpg"></img>
      <p>using <b>Drake's equation</b> we can calculate the number of aliens in our galaxy which is quiet high but...<br><h2>why shouldn't we find aliens</h2>we shouldn't find aliens because according to the dark forest theory we can see alien civilisation as wild hunters who are super intelligent and seeking to resorces because they have exploited there's now if they find us first thing they do is to kill humanity so our resources can be their</p>
